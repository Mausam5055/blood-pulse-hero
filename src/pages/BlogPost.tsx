      title: 'The Science Behind Blood Types: What Every Donor Should Know',
      content: `
        <div class="article-content">
          <p class="lead-paragraph">Blood donation is one of the most critical medical procedures that saves millions of lives annually. Understanding the science behind blood types is essential for both donors and recipients to ensure safe and effective transfusions.</p>
          
          <h2>Understanding the ABO System</h2>
          <p>The ABO blood group system, discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, classifies human blood into four main types: A, B, AB, and O. This classification is based on the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells.</p>
          
          <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Did You Know?</h4>
            <p>Karl Landsteiner won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for his discovery of human blood groups.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3>Type A Blood</h3>
          <p>Individuals with Type A blood have A antigens on their red blood cells and anti-B antibodies in their plasma. This means they can donate to people with Type A and Type AB blood, and can receive blood from Type A and Type O donors.</p>
          
          <h3>Type B Blood</h3>
          <p>Type B blood contains B antigens on red blood cells and anti-A antibodies in plasma. Type B individuals can donate to Type B and Type AB recipients, and can receive from Type B and Type O donors.</p>
          
          <h3>Type AB Blood - The Universal Recipient</h3>
          <p>Type AB blood has both A and B antigens but no anti-A or anti-B antibodies. This makes Type AB individuals universal recipients for red blood cells, as they can receive blood from any ABO type.</p>
          
          <h3>Type O Blood - The Universal Donor</h3>
          <p>Type O blood has no A or B antigens but contains both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Type O negative is known as the universal donor because it can be given to patients of any blood type in emergency situations.</p>
          
          <h2>The Rh Factor</h2>
          <p>The Rh factor is another crucial component of blood typing. It refers to the presence (+) or absence (-) of the RhD antigen on red blood cells. This creates eight main blood types: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-.</p>
          
          <div class="stats-grid">
            <div class="stat-item">
              <h4>45%</h4>
              <p>Population with O+ blood type</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
              <h4>6.6%</h4>
              <p>Population with O- blood type</p>

          </div>
          
          <h2>Why Blood Type Matters</h2>
          <p>Incompatible blood transfusions can trigger severe immune reactions, including:</p>
          <ul class="enhanced-list">
            <li>Hemolytic transfusion reactions</li>
            <li>Acute kidney failure</li>
            <li>Shock and potentially death</li>
            <li>Fever and chills</li>
            <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>The Donation Process</h2>
          <p>Modern blood donation is a carefully controlled process that ensures both donor safety and blood quality. The entire process typically takes 45-60 minutes, with the actual blood collection lasting only 8-12 minutes.</p>
          
          <h3>Pre-Donation Screening</h3>
          <p>Every donor undergoes thorough screening including:</p>
          <ul class="enhanced-list">
            <li>Medical history questionnaire</li>
            <li>Mini-physical examination</li>
            <li>Hemoglobin level testing</li>
            <li>Blood pressure and pulse check</li>
            <li>Temperature measurement</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="quote-box">
            <blockquote>
              "Every blood donation can save up to three lives. It's one of the most powerful ways an individual can make a direct impact on their community."

        <div class="article-content">
          <p class="lead-paragraph">Proper preparation can make your blood donation experience smoother, safer, and more comfortable. These five simple health tips will help ensure you're in the best possible condition for your donation while maximizing the quality of your gift.</p>
          
          <h2>Tip 1: Hydrate Properly</h2>
          <p>Proper hydration is crucial for a successful donation. Your blood volume is made up of about 55% plasma, which is roughly 90% water. When you're well-hydrated, donation is easier and you'll feel better afterward.</p>
          
          <div class="tip-detail">
            <h4>Hydration Guidelines:</h4>
            <ul class="enhanced-list">
              <li>Drink 16 ounces of water 2 hours before donation</li>
              <li>Continue drinking fluids throughout the day</li>
              <li>Avoid alcohol for 24 hours before and after donation</li>
              <li>Limit caffeine on donation day</li>
              <li>Continue hydrating for 24 hours post-donation</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <h3>Signs of Proper Hydration</h3>
          <p>You'll know you're properly hydrated when your urine is pale yellow or clear, you feel alert and energetic, and your skin feels supple rather than dry.</p>
          
          <h2>Tip 2: Eat Iron-Rich Foods</h2>
          <p>Iron is essential for healthy red blood cell production. Donors with adequate iron levels not only pass the pre-donation screening more easily but also recover faster after donation.</p>
          
          <div class="iron-foods">
            <h4>Excellent Iron Sources:</h4>
            <div class="food-categories">
              <div class="category">
                <h5>Heme Iron (easily absorbed):</h5>
                <p>Red meat, poultry, fish, shellfish</p>
              </div>
              <div class="category">
                <h5>Non-Heme Iron (plant-based):</h5>
                <p>Spinach, lentils, tofu, fortified cereals, beans</p>
              </div>
              <div class="category">
                <h5>Iron Absorption Enhancers:</h5>
                <p>Vitamin C-rich foods like citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Iron Absorption Tip</h4>
            <p>Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources to increase absorption. For example, add bell peppers to your spinach salad or drink orange juice with your iron-fortified cereal.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h2>Tip 3: Get Quality Sleep</h2>
          <p>Adequate rest helps your body function optimally and can prevent donation-related fatigue or dizziness. Well-rested donors typically have better donation experiences.</p>
          
          <h3>Sleep Recommendations:</h3>
          <ul class="enhanced-list">
            <li>Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep the night before donation</li>
            <li>Maintain a consistent sleep schedule</li>
            <li>Avoid screens for at least 1 hour before bedtime</li>
            <li>Create a comfortable sleep environment</li>
            <li>Avoid heavy meals or caffeine close to bedtime</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="stats-grid">
            <div class="stat-item">
              <h4>7-9 hours</h4>
              <p>Recommended sleep for adults</p>

            <div class="stat-item">
              <h4>23%</h4>
              <p>Reduction in donation complications with adequate sleep</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
              <h4>1 hour</h4>
              <p>Screen-free time before bed recommended</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <h2>Tip 4: Time Your Meals Right</h2>
          <p>What and when you eat before donation can significantly impact your experience. The right nutrition provides energy and helps prevent low blood sugar during and after donation.</p>
          
          <h3>Pre-Donation Meal Guidelines:</h3>
          <div class="meal-timing">
            <div class="timing-item">
              <h4>3-4 Hours Before:</h4>
              <p>Eat a substantial, balanced meal with protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timing-item">
              <h4>1-2 Hours Before:</h4>
              <p>Light snack if needed - avoid heavy, fatty, or very sweet foods.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timing-item">
              <h4>30 Minutes Before:</h4>
              <p>Stick to water or light, non-caffeinated beverages.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <h3>Ideal Pre-Donation Foods:</h3>
          <ul class="enhanced-list">
            <li>Whole grain toast with peanut butter</li>
            <li>Greek yogurt with berries and granola</li>
            <li>Oatmeal with banana and nuts</li>
            <li>Lean protein with vegetables and rice</li>
            <li>Smoothie with fruits, vegetables, and protein powder</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Foods to Avoid:</h3>
          <ul class="enhanced-list">
            <li>High-fat foods (can affect blood tests)</li>
            <li>Very sugary snacks or drinks</li>
            <li>Alcoholic beverages</li>
            <li>Excessive caffeine</li>
            <li>Foods you've never tried before</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Tip 5: Manage Stress and Stay Positive</h2>
          <p>Mental preparation is just as important as physical preparation. Stress and anxiety can affect your blood pressure and overall donation experience.</p>
          
          <h3>Stress Management Techniques:</h3>
          <div class="stress-techniques">
            <div class="technique">
              <h4>Deep Breathing</h4>

            </div>
            <div class="technique">
              <h4>Positive Visualization</h4>
              <p>Imagine the positive impact your donation will have on someone's life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">

              <p>Try progressive muscle relaxation or meditation before your appointment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="technique">
              <h4>Bring Support</h4>
              <p>Consider bringing a friend or family member for moral support.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="quote-box">
